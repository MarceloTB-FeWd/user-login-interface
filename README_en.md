# Project Name

Project - Login/Register Interface

> This project represents the continuation of studies focused on front-end development for web pages. Therefore,
it should be considered part of a long journey in web development.

> This site was created with HTML5, CSS3, and JS as part of my web development learning.
> It is a login page where the end user can register (if they don't already have an account) or go directly to log in.

## Features

- Optimized for screen sizes up to 650px and 400px;
- When the user clicks on "register," an interaction is triggered (like sliding a door from left to right), revealing the
registration area (this area is hidden behind the login area) and only appears if the "click" action occurs;
- If the user is in the registration area but interacts with the "login" button through a "click," an interaction is
triggered (like sliding a door from right to left), revealing the login area.

## Technologies Used

- Software - Visual Studio Code (for coding);
- HTML5 (structure of the site);
- CSS3 (site styling);
- JS (logic for user interaction);
- Git (for local and remote interactions via the command line);
- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) (for free site hosting).

## Note

> Although the project includes a programming language (js), even though the end user can interact with the page fields,
no data can be submitted to any server. The focus here was not on making requests or consuming an API. At this stage, I'm
still developing my initial studies, which is part of the process toward reaching back-end development.
